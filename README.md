# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Revisited version of the first Javascript project on The Odin Project course, it's a web verson of the famous game "Rock, paper, scissors." 

Some improvement from the previus version are:
1. Use of Javascript DOM Manipolation.
2. Added the UI (The game was able to play only from the console before).

It was a fun project to build.
